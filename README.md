# Coding Challenge Repository

## Overview
This repository contains the solutions for a coding challenge with multiple problem sets. Each problem set is placed in its folder and includes the solution code along with a `README.md` that describes the problem, solution approach, and instructions on how to run the code.

### Problem Sets
The coding challenge includes the following problem sets:
1. **Problem Set 1: Palindrome Pairs**
   - Given a list of unique words, the task is to find all pairs of distinct indices where the concatenation of the two words forms a palindrome.
   
2. **Problem Set 2: Valid Parentheses**
   - Determine if a given string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']' is valid based on proper matching and order of closing brackets.

3. **Problem Set 3: Longest Increasing Subsequence**
   - Given an unsorted array of integers, the task is to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
